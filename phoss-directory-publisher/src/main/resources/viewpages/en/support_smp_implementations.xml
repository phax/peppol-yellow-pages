<p>
  The Peppol Directory specification is newer than the Peppol SMP specification and
  therefore not all SMPs support Peppol Directory.
  This page contains all known SMP implementations that are known to support the Peppol Directory
  specification.
</p>

<p>
  Since October 3<sup>rd</sup> 2019 all Peppol SMP providers MUST be able to support the 
  Peppol Directory interface from their SMPs.
  Specification v1.1 is the latest one.
